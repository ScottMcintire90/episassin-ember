  <h1> Look at this face.</h1>

  <p>
    <div class="frodo">
      <img src="frodo.jpg" style="height:300px; width:400px;"/>
      <p>How sweet is he?</p>
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>Who would ever guess that face is really just a result of propogandist Peter Jackson and his bevy of photoshop masters?

      <p>The REAL Frodo</p>
    </div>
  </p>

  <p>He's not the only one in his family to have resorted to trickery in order to keep a fair face. As the admitted enemy of the state Samwise Gamgee once said, "a servant of the enemy would look fairer and feel fouler". Well the Baggins' have mastered the art of       tricking the <span id="red">Dark Lord's</span> servants in believing their fair visages.   Just look at his "uncle" and thief of the <span id="red">Lord's</span> Ring.<p>

  <div class="column">
    <p>That is Bilbo before he quit using our <span id="red">Dark Lord's</span> Ring to fool others into believing he was a much younger Hobbit. Just look at see what he looks like once he passes on the Ring to Frodo, allowing the deception to pass on to the next generation of Baggins'.</p>

  <h2>My Point?</h2>
    <p>That the agents of the enemy use supernatural means, even turning our <span id="red">Dark Lord's</span> artifacts and powers against him and to their own ends. That's not something a "good" guy would do now is it?
