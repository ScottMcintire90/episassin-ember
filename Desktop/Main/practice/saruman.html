<h1>OUR GREAT AND NOBLE HERO, SARUMAN THE WHITE, ALSO KNOWN AS SARUMAN OF MANY COLORS.</h1>
  <p>Saruman, the man who brought us the great <a href="uruk.html">Uruk-Hai</a>. While it has been said by the detractors of Sauron, our great<span id="red"> Lord and Savior</span> that he is nothing but a pawn whose hunger for power led directly to the takeover of the Shire even after the death of our <span id="red">Lord and Savior</span> and the enslavement of all those adowable wittle Hobbits.</p>
  <p>This could not be further from the truth! Saruman is a great and noble hero to our cause.
