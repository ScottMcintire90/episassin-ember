  <h1>THE MISUNDERSTOOD RACE</h1>
    <p>It is my aim with this site to counteract the nefarious propoganda put forth by the so-called "good" men and elves of Middle Earth.</p>
    <p>It is their assertion that the Uruk Hai are inherently evil, killing and pillaging willy-nilly. To be fair, who could blame them? Who could dare to love this face?</p>

    <p>But I tell you! This is a lie! Put forth by the schemer Gandalf and his pawn, Aragorn. Or shall we call him "Strider"?
    <p>The supposed "good guys" would have you believe these are merely corrupted and tortured elves, but this is also a lie! A lie I say! These brave former elves are defectors, fleeing their people and seeking political asylum in Mordor.</p>
