    No one wants to believe that Gandalf the <span id="grey">Grey</span>, also named "the good" is capable of great and immense evil. After all, who could ever forget the image of this smiling old man and his bag of wonderous tricks and fireworks?!

    But to ignore his many crimes against the folk of Middle Earth is to forget the damage he has done, in committing xenocide against the Balrog people. Lest we forget, he murdered the last of the Balrogs in Moria during the course of his self-serving quest to take down <span id= "red"> Our Lord and Savior</span> Sauron.
